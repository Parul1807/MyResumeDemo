<p>Hi sir/ma'am, <br> My name is <strong>Parul singh</strong> and I am from Renukoot. I have done my <strong> Masterâ€™s in Computer Application </strong> from <strong >Banaras Hindu University.</strong>
    I had learned Machine Learning, SQL, Java, Web Development courses in my academics. 
    I wanted to explore how these concepts that I learnt in University are being used in the Industry.
