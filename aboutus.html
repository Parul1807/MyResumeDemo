    <h1> AboutUs page</h1>
<p>Hi sir/ma'am, <br> My name is <strong>Parul singh</strong> and I am from Renukoot. I have done my <strong> Masterâ€™s in Computer Application </strong> from <strong >Banaras Hindu University.</strong>
    I had learned Machine Learning, SQL, Java, and Web Development courses in my academics. 
    I wanted to explore how these concepts that I learnt in University are being used in the Industry.
     So, I joined a professional Software training institute, Ducat Noida, where I worked on the project of an Online Banking System. It was really good exposure for me. I also joined Tutedude, and I have completed my Web Development course. <br> 
    I also love to explore new trends in technology. At Present, I am looking for an opportunity in the IT sector to start my career, so that I can expand my knowledge and professional skills. <br>
    Thank you
